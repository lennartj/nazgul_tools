# Setting up your IDE

The Nazgul Framework provides a setup for Maven, including several plugins which check licensing, codestyle,
pom properties etc. Most developers, however, spend the majority of their development time within the Integrated
Development Environment. Providing a configuration for the IDE which matches the plugin configuration
for Maven's build cycle greatly simplifies the job of focusing on development instead of setup.

Unfortunately, most IDEs have custom and incompatible setup configurations for the various steps that handle
code formatting, project imports etc. Each IDE has a slightly different way to perform setup:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th width="50%">Integrated Development Environment Setup Link</th>
        <th width="50%">Setup Compliance Status</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>[IntelliJ IDEA 12.x](idea.html)</td>
        <td>Release Candidate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>[Eclipse Juno](eclipse.html)</td>
        <td>Alpha</td>
    </tr>
