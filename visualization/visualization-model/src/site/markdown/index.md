# Nazgul Tools: Visualization Model

The Visualization Model defines entities containing properties from the [Graphviz/Dot](http://www.graphviz.org)
diagram specification. All entity classes are JAXB-annotated to ensure that the model can be converted in a simple 
manner to and from XML and JSON formats.
