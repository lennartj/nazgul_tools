# What is the Nazgul Framework?

<img src="images/nazgul.jpg" style="float:right" width="203" height="236"/> The Nazgul Framework project holds a
collection of best-pracises and sensible configurations enabling you to start projects quickly and scale them to huge
sizes without having to change the development or deployment model. Moreover, the Nazgul Framework strives to increase
usability for the developers and architects working on a project, as well as reduce complexity/tanglement and increase
productivity.

The Nazgul Framework has two main components:

1. **Nazgul Framework: Tools**. The Nazgul Tools project (this reactor) aims to use best-of-breed tools to achieve a
    usable, well-composed and simple mode of development and deployment. It defines codestyle,
    IDE integration and global aspects usable in any project development.

2. **Nazgul Framework: Core**. The Nazgul Core project (another reactor) provides a set of commonly useable library
    tools, built on top of the Nazgul Tools codestyle, IDE integration and global aspects. These tools are mainly
    self-sustaining and are ready to be integrated and used in any project.

## What can the Nazgul Framework do for my project?

In short: Increase your productivity, raise your server uptime and provide scalable projects.
Using the Nazgul Framework lets you focus on development while deployment, scalability and reduced tanglement are
inherited from the choices within the Nazgul Framework.

## How should I proceed?

The following roadmap is recommended:

1. Read [a brief overview of the Nazgul Tools reactor](nazgul_tools.html).

2. Read through the thoughs and structure of [Nazgul Software Components](nazgul_tools.html).

3. Import some components from Nazgul Framework: Core for direct use - or use the `nazgul-tools-external-parent` as a
   parent within your development project as shown in [Nazgul Software Components](nazgul_tools.html).
