# Plugin reactor

The Nazgul Framework: Tools reactor does generally not deliver Maven plugins, but is rather a collection of best
practises and existing plugins combined to extract maximum usability. However, in the case that existing plugins
are laden with bugs which makes them unusable in a Nazgul Tools reactor, this folder contains patched plugin codebases
as required to make the Nazgul tools reactor work properly.
